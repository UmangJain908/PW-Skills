        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "   - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning method used to predict a value using one input variable.\n",
        "   - It finds a straight-line relationship between an independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "   - Purpose:\n",
        "      To understand the relationship between two variables\n",
        "      To predict future values\n",
        "   - Formula: Y=mX+c\n",
        "   - Example: Predict marks from study hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "   - Key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR):\n",
        "   - Linear relationship – X and Y have a straight-line relationship.\n",
        "   - Independence – Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "   - Homoscedasticity – Constant variance of errors.\n",
        "   - Normality of errors – Residuals are normally distributed.\n",
        "   - No outliers – Extreme values should not strongly affect the model.\n",
        "\n",

        "   explain each term.\n",
        "    - Simple Linear Regression Equation: Y=mX+c\n",
        "    - Explanation of terms:\n",
        "      - Y – Dependent variable (output to be predicted)\n",
        "      - X – Independent variable (input)\n",
        "      - m – Slope (change in Y for one unit change in X)\n",
        "      - c – Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",

        "    - Real-world example of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
        "      - Predicting salary based on years of experience.\n",
        "      - X (independent variable): Years of experience\n",

        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "    - The method of least squares is used to find the best-fit line in linear\n",
        "       regression.\n",
        "   - It works by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the actual\n",
        "       values and the predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "    - Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification, especially for binary outcomes like yes/no or pass/fail. It predicts the probability of an event using a sigmoid (S-shaped) function.\n",
        "    - Linear Regression, on the other hand, is used for predicting continuous values such as salary or marks and uses a straight-line equation.\n",
        "    - The main difference is that Linear Regression gives numerical outputs, while Logistic Regression gives class-based outputs (0 or 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression\n",
        "   models.\n",
        "    - Three common evaluation metrics for regression models are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²). MAE measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values. MSE calculates the average of squared errors, giving more weight to large errors. R-squared shows how well the model explains the variability in the data, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "   - The purpose of the R-squared (R²) metric is to measure how well a regression model explains the variation in the dependent variable. It shows the proportion of data variance explained by the model. An R-squared value closer to 1 means a better model fit, while a value closer to 0 means a poor fit.\n"
