        "   - Interpreted languages execute code line by line (e.g., Python).\n",
        "   - Compiled languages translate the whole code into machine code before\n",
        "     execution (e.g., C++).\n",
        "   - Interpreted programs are slower but easier to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - Exception handling is a way to handle runtime errors using try, except,\n",
        "     else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "   - It prevents the program from crashing when an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "   - The finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "   - It is used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "   - Logging is used to record program events or errors for debugging or\n",

        "   - It helps track what the program is doing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is deleted or\n",
        "     destroyed.\n",
        "   - It is used to perform cleanup before an object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "   - 'import module' imports the whole module.\n",
        "   - 'from module import function' imports specific functions or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "   - You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or a tuple\n",
        "     of exceptions:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     try:\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "   - The with statement automatically opens and closes files.\n",
        "   - It ensures files are properly closed even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "   - Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process (shares\n",
        "     memory).\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing runs multiple processes, each with its own memory.\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "    - Helps in debugging and tracking issues.\n",
        "    - Can store logs for future analysis.\n",
        "    - Works even after program execution for auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "    - It handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically.\n",

        "      management.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    - try: Write code that might raise an error.\n",
        "    - except: Handle the error.\n",
        "    - else: Execute if no error occurs.\n",
        "    - finally: Execute always for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "    - Prevents memory leaks and improves performance.\n",
        "    - Ensures resources are efficiently used.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    - try: Contains the code that may cause an error.\n",
        "    - except: Handles the error that occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    - It uses reference counting to track object usage.\n",
        "    - When references drop to zero, the object is deleted.\n",
        "    - The garbage collector also removes circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",

        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "    - DEBUG\n",

        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "    - os.fork() works only on Unix and creates a child process.\n",
        "    - multiprocessing works on all platforms and provides higher-level process control.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "    - It releases system resources.\n",
        "    - Prevents data loss or file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "    - file.read() reads the entire file content.\n",
        "    - file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "    - The logging module provides a flexible way to record messages or errors during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "    - It helps interact with the operating system.\n",
        "    - Used for operations like creating, removing, or checking files and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "    - Circular references between objects.\n",
